Need to install all of the below packages 

pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install selenium
pip install Django
pip install requests
pip install django-crontab
pip install django-cors-headers
pip install djangorestframework
pip install django

on macos or linux you should be able to do 'crontab -e' in the terminal and it should open a window
in that window you can add a line of code of :

You may need to change the path between your python3/python.exe file, and where the manage.py file is located on your local machine
'0 15 * * 6 /usr/bin/python3 djangoReact-articles/backend/manage.py scrapeNews'
This will schedule a task every saturday, at 15:00 UTC, which is 7AM in PST.
This link will tell when the crontab is running.

To use Email Message you need to create an App Password,
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
Changing your email in scrapeNews.py on line 90 inputting the password that is given from the link above.

If you want to test or manually call the function,
go into the project file, 
cd djangoReact-articles/backend/webscraper
From this you should be able to call 'python manage.py sendEmail' or 'python manage.py scrapeNews'
scrapeNews scrapes new information and sends an email
sendEmail only sends an email on the most recent information.

Similarily you can delete the database, using 'python manage.py delete_all' removing all values.
